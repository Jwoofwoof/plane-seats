According to the CDC, Covid-19 is most likely to spread among people who have close contact. 
And that’s why we have to keep social distace from other people. The CDC is suggesting that 
we should stay at least six feet from other people, however, on the airplane, it is hard to 
keep the social distance. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, airlines are cancelling lots of 
flights. Some airlines are only abandoning the middle seat to separate the passengers, but 
that’s only about 3 feet apart from the person next to you.

This program will take in a text file which contains the airplane name and all the passengers’ 
names. Something like this:
    
    Airplane Name: Boeing 747
    Jason Sung
    Andy Jack
    Mandy Kaw
        …

And with the name of the airplane, the program can see how the seats are configured on the 
particular airplane. And then it uses 6 feet (for Covid-19) as the radius of the circle to 
calculate the maximum number of passengers this airplane can have to guarantee the safe distance. 
If the number of passengers is less than the maximum, then we can increase the radius of the 
circle, and rearrange the passenger seats so that the passengers are sitting further away from 
each other to lower the risk. To conclude, this program can arrange seats for every passenger 
to maximize the distance between each passeng
